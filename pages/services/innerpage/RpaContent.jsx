            Today, automation is taking charge of the industries globally. it
            may, at first, seem like jobs of millions are in danger but

            Automation is directly touching lives of billions making them more
            efficient and productive at work by increasing focus on more vital
            and result-driven actions fuelling growth of the organization.
            automation is reducing the no. Of petty and repetitive tasks at
            hands with individuals thus increasing the overall efficiency and
            reducing the total time consumption in performing one task.

            Put simply, rpa is a process of simplifying and automating tasks
            that require human interference. rpa with the use of a software with
            artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities that is
            stable to handle high volume repetitive tasks. Sorting and
            short-listing the relevant profile for hr, maintaining records of
            transactions and even making calculations are some of the many
            applications of the RPA system.

        Many times, rpa is misunderstood as artificial intelligence (AI). Just
        to clarify here, these are two different areas of technologies. while ai
        predicts the future trends based on past data, RPA fetches and processes
        the data.
